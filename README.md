**Real Estate Analysis in an NYC Neighborhood (Bushwick)**
**May 2024 - Jul 2024**

**Conducted a comprehensive real estate market analysis for a company considering opening an office in Bushwick, NY, examining trends from 2009 to 2021 through descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.**

**Descriptive Analysis:** Identified a decline in annual residential property sales, with median price per square foot comparisons highlighting Bushwick's cost efficiency compared to high-sale-volume neighborhoods. The areaâ€™s proximity to Williamsburg and Manhattan, along with its ongoing gentrification, indicates strong market potential.

**Predictive Analysis:** Used time series forecasting and multiple regression models in RStudio to project a steady increase in total residential real estate sales over the next eight quarters, suggesting sustained market growth.

**Prescriptive Analysis:** Employed an optimization model in Excel Solver to determine strategic investment decisions. 

The analysis found that:

A 5.00% commission rate with two additional employees (for a total office space of 500 sq. ft.) would optimize profitability, leading to a 6.5% market penetration and an NPV of $6.40 million.

A 4.67% commission rate with the same office setup would result in 7.0% market penetration but a lower NPV of $3.26 million.
Investing $106 more per month than the allotted budget could double profits.

This analysis provided data-driven recommendations to guide the company's market entry decision, demonstrating that Bushwick offers strong financial viability, scalability, and cost efficiency. However, if stakeholders aim for maximum profit with slightly higher investment flexibility, Bedford-Stuyvesant was identified as an alternative option.
